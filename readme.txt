The "URLShortenerBenchmark" project represents a comprehensive exploration of strategies for shortening and expanding URL addresses. Comprising a diverse set of classes and methods, this project serves as an in-depth investigation into the performance of various identifier and string data storage methods.

The project revolves around the central idea of creating a platform for comparative evaluation and testing of the efficacy of different storage strategies in the context of handling URL addresses. Implementing various storage strategies allows assessing how each one impacts the speed of obtaining identifiers and their corresponding URL addresses.

Within the project, various data storage strategies are implemented, including hash maps, file storage, and others. Tests conducted using these strategies enable an assessment of which approach is the most effective and suitable for handling large volumes of data.

The project aims to provide developers with a tool to make informed decisions when selecting a data storage strategy that best suits their specific tasks. The results of testing and analysis help understand which strategies offer optimal performance when processing substantial amounts of data and are well-suited for specific usage scenarios.
